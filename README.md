Sproing: A jQuery Plugin
==========
Why does this exist? Not sure.
What does it do? It sproings text. Don't ask me what that means.

Usage:

$(selector).sproing() - Sproings the text contained within the first node matched by the selector. This function assumes that there are no non-text child nodes.
